# Intro To Augmented Rality 302
_Trystan Rivers 2020_

Extremely helpful projects: 

https://github.com/Rightpoint/ARKit-CoreML - Provided a framework for Machine Learning in AR, as well as a framework for this app
https://github.com/floatmingo/BitCardPoker - Provides a library for evaluating poker hands, extremely useful and works well

Initially, I intended to use a machine learning model to classify every playing card, but ARKit really struggled to recognize the differences between playing cards, due to repetetive structures and extremely similar layouts and images.
